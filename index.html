        <h2>Fox</h2>
        <p>Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. They have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush).</p>
        <p>Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes.</p>
        <p>Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.</p>
        <p>The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world.</p>

        <h2>Squirrel</h2>
        <p>Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that includes small or medium-size rodents.</p>
        <p>The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots (including groundhogs), flying squirrels, and prairie dogs amongst other rodents.</p>
        <p>Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia.</p>
        <p>The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene epoch, and among other living rodent families, the squirrels are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormice.</p>

        <h2>Bear</h2>
        <p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.</p>
        <p>Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
        <p>Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.</p>

        <h2>Wolf</h2>
        <p>The wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America.</p>
        <p>More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as popularly understood, comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies.</p>
        <p>The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae. It is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail.</p>
        <p>The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them.</p>
        <p>The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.</p>

        <h2>Mandrill</h2>
        <p>The mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) is a primate of the Old World monkey (Cercopithecidae) family.</p>
        <p>It is one of two species in the genus Mandrillus, along with the drill. Although they superficially resemble baboons, they are more closely related to mangabeys of the genus Cercocebus.</p>
        <p>Mandrills are found in southern Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of the Congo. Mandrills mostly live in tropical rainforest and in large groups.</p>
        <p>Mandrills have an omnivorous diet consisting mostly of fruits and insects. Their mating season peaks in July to September, with a corresponding birth peak in December to April.</p>
        <p>Mandrills are the world's largest monkeys. The mandrill is classified as vulnerable by IUCN.</p>

        <h2>Lion</h2>
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.</p>
        <p>It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides.</p>
        <p>A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates.</p>
        <p>The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>
        <p>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight.</p>
